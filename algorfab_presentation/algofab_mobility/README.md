# Algofab Mobility

## Context

Suppose a user / researcher whishes to take advantage of the features of Algofab but works in a secluded environment (cut off from the internet for security reasons), therefore he cannot access [main] Algofab in said environemnt.

The solution to this problem is to move Algofab inside the user's working environment, which is possible because of the "Mobility" feature of Algofab.

## Outcome

* Being able to deploy a local intance of Algofab

## Workflow components

* the [WFC 1](./download.md) : download and configure the Algofab project
* the [WFC 2](./run.md) : Run and Test the deployment
