## Context

## Outcome

* Being able to upload a resource on Algofab through the portal 

## Pre-requisites

* Signin up on Algofab

## Instructions

_Note: If you haven't signed up on Algofab yet, please [do so]() before proceeding further._

There are two parts :

### Create the resource

These are what you need to  successfully upload and attract more users: 
* Archive (required): compress the file tree of your resource in to a .zip archive.
* Documentation (recommended): make a documentation to share with interested users, how to make the best out of the resource. The documentation is optional but it is strongly recommended unless you wish to make the resource a private one (for your own use only), otherwise users won't know how to use your resource.

When the aforementionned are ready, head to the [resource creation page]() and fill in the form. 

More information about the different fields in [that entry of the documentation]().

You will be redirected to the newly created resource's page once the creation is successfull, there you can manage it however you want.

### Upload the archive:

You need to head to the resource's page and hover on the "Download" section. As the author of the resource, you should see an "Edit" button appear on the upper right corner of the section, click on it.

You should now see a form asking you to upload the archive, follow the instructions and after a successful upload, reload the page.

You can check by clicking on the "Download Archvie" button, if you do, you should receive the exact same archive you previously uploaded.
