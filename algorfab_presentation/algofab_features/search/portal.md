# Marketplace : Search on Portal (workflow)

## Outcome 
* Being able to perform searches on the portal

## Pre-requisites

* Signin up on Algofab

## Instructions 

_Note: If you haven't signed up on Algofab yet, please [do so]() before proceeding further._

Head to the [search page]() on Algofab portal, type the text to search in the form presented and click on the "Search" button to make the search.

 
*__About searches__: when performing searches the text can be formatted as you would do in a google search (i.e. with keywords such as AND, OR, with minus ...). The search will be applied on the following fields of the database documents: __name__, __description__ and __tags__. Hence be sure to make those fields especially as self explanatory as possible when you [create resources]()*

*__About filters__: you can also finetune the results to eliminate resources that do not meet your requirements using the filtering feature. You cann filter by: __name__, __tags__ and __type__ (type is : notebook, docker containers, library, dataset ...)*
