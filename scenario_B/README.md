# Scenario B

## Context 

In the context of the EUHubs4Data project, an SME to experiment on the marketplace. Another DIH will provide datasets, a third DIH will provide algorithm. The SME will need an autonomous workspace and eventually, more algorithm for his needs.

Everything whether algorithms, data or marketplace will all be running / available in the client’s autonomous workspace. 

## Prerequisites

* [Create an Autonomous Workspace]()
  * Add user accounts for the SME and the two DIHs each
* [Deploy an instance of TeraLab Marketplace]()

## Instructions

### Variables

### Manual
* [Experiment on the Marketplace]()
* [Import Resources]()

## Outcome (Validation Condition):

* An autonomous workspace containing a Marketplace instance to experiment with
