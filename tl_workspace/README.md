# Creating a TeraLab Workspace

## Context 

A TeraLab workspace is a secure (at differing level, discuss with teralab for more information) environment useful for research and development purposes in particular when it comes to Datascience and AI (TeraLab can provide GPU-enabled VMs for a better processing of AI algorithms).

At a technical level, it a cluster of virtual machines (VMs) running in a private network, with controlled acess according to the need of client's needs and managed in a datacenter by teralab's team.

## Prerequisites


## Instructions

### Variables

### Manual:

* First contact [TeraLab's team](mailto:admin@teralab-datascience.fr) to discuss your use case
* If and when you have a deal, you will get an [Excel document]() detailing the characteristics of the workspace to build for the record, including :
 * the number of clusters: 
 * for each cluster the number of VMs :
 * for each VMs, their characteristics : vCPU, Memory, Disk and GPU
 * access at a service-level to your VMs: can be done by two means:
   * Port forwarding
   * Reverse proxying: for web type services only
 * eventually backup server
* You will also get a [terms of use]() document you need sign and return to teralab's team
* Once the two aforementioned documents are properly filled in and received by TeraLab, wait for about a month for your workspace to be ready for use.

## Outcome (Validation Condition):

* Access to a brand new TeraLab workspace ready to run your project.
