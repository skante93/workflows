These are what you need to  successfully upload and attract more users: 
* Archive: compress the file tree of your resource in to an archive.
* Documentation: make a documentation to share with interested users how to make the best out of the resource. The documentation is optional but it is strongly recommended unless you wish to make the resource a private one (users won't know or will have a hard time understanding how to use the resource).
